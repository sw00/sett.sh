Summary: Lets try this blogging thing again. No really! I'll post stuff I swear!

I spent some time setting up a blog once again. I had the domain and free 
hosting(ala [gitub pages](http://pages.github.com/)) lying around going to 
waste anyway. Hopefully, this time I'll end up writing more than two posts a year.

Maybe someone will even read this - someone who isn't future me.

### Technical stuff
If you're interested in the technical behind this blog, I'm using [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com).
It's a static site generator, which means unlike full-fledged blogging frameworks like [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) 
or [Ghost](http://ghost.org), the static html gets generated from templates and then uploaded to be hosted.

Github provides free hosting and the domain is my own.
