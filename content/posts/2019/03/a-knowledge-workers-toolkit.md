Knowledge work can have some pretty tricky characteristics that renders it distinct from physical work. For one, it defies quantification. While
chefs, carpenters and other tradespeople can their efforts take shape into concrete, material output, the knowledge worker is not so fortunate.
Our raw materials are intangible - what tools could we use to manipulate them? Likewise, our output can seem quite ephemeral - did the thing we produced
actually add value, by what measure[^value]? Worst of all, our effort[^effort] is elastic and difficult to wield in a consistent and predictable way. Effort spent does 
not always translate into value extracted. Something as simple as a change of perspective can yield great benefits of orders of magnitude, while 
we can stutter and struggle for days on the next basic task[^parkinsons].

Despair. How are we to cope with this and take control of our own faculties? What tools can we build to apply to our problems? By applying a little metacognition[^metacognition],
we can explore the this notion and perhaps obtain some tools for thought.

# Mental Models and their building blocks

When you think of a pink elephant, where does it exist? 

# Abstractions and Properties

- Magnitude
- Complexity
- Local and global effects.
- Temporal or sequential properties
- Boundaries and borders

[^value]: And will it remain valuable or will it diminish?

[^effort]: What does it mean to expend effort? Can "effort" be substituted for "attention" or something else?

[^parkinsons]: chances are, you've probably experienced a fair share of [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) in action.

[^process]: To make matters worse, institutions have reached for the only incumbent tools they know: process. Processes designed for managing assembly lines in the industrial revolution are haphazardly being applied in the office environment. But that's a rant for another time.

[^metacognition]: Thinking about how you're thinking.
