Knowledge work can have some pretty tricky characteristics that renders it distinct from physical work. For one, it defies quantification. While
chefs, carpenters and other tradespeople can their efforts take shape into concrete, material output, the knowledge worker is not so fortunate.
Our raw materials are intangible - what tools could we use to manipulate them? Likewise, our output itself can be quite ephemeral - did the thing we produced
actually add value and by what measure? Worst of all, our effort is elastic and difficult to wield in a consistent and predictable way. Effort spent does 
not always translate into value extracted. Something as simple as a change of perspective can yield great benefits of orders of magnitude, while 
we can struggle for days on the next basic task[^parkinsons].

Despair. How are we to cope with this and take control of our own faculties? What tools can we build to apply to our problems?

# Mental Models and their building blocks

> All models are wrong


# Abstractions and Properties

- Local and global effects.
- Temporal or sequential properties
- Boundaries and borders

[^parkinsons]: the effect of [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) is probably most pronounced in software development.

[^process]: To make matters worse, institutions have reached for the only incumbent tools they know: process. Processes designed for managing assembly lines in the industrial revolution are haphazardly being applied in the office environment. But that's a rant for another time.
