Knowledge work can have some pretty tricky characteristics that renders it
distinct from physical work. For one, it defies quantification. While chefs,
carpenters and other tradespeople can their efforts take shape into concrete,
material output, the knowledge worker is not so fortunate.

Our raw materials are intangible - what tools could we use to manipulate them?
Likewise, our output can seem quite ephemeral - did the thing we produced
actually add value, by what measure[^value]? Worst of all, our effort[^effort]
is elastic and difficult to wield in a consistent and predictable way.  Effort
spent does not always translate into value extracted. Often something as
nebulous as a change of perspective can yield great benefits of orders of
magnitude, while we can stutter and struggle for days to achieve then next
basic outcome[^parkinsons].

Despair. How are we to cope with this and take control of our own faculties?
What tools can we build to apply to our problems? By applying a little
metacognition (thinking about how we're thinking), we can be a bit more
deliberate and perhaps obtain some tools for thought.

# Mental Models

Arguably the closests thing to a tools we have are the mental models we employ
when working on a task. This is true is the most general sense, from changing a
tyre to analysing a dataset. We're always using an abstraction to make sense of
the world and using it to make decisions that will give us the outcome we want.
If the mental model we employ corresponds closely to the external world and
then we have a greater chance of success.

All models have limitations, however. They're always bounded approximations
since we're only human and not omiscient: we can't keep the full description of
the universe in our heads. So it's useful to be aware of the limitations and
assumptions of the model we're using. Find the boundaries, so to speak, and we
may expose our own biases.

## Bias

Bias in this case is the tendency for a mental model to favour certain outcomes
when applied in a context. It's not inherently bad, despite what we've learnt
through popular consciousness.

I like to think of the popular quote by George Box to reason about this[^box]:

> "All models are wrong but some are useful."

He was of course referring specifically to statistical models, but I think it
can be generalised into "all abstractions are wrong but some are useful".

A cleaver is great at chopping things but perhaps rather unwieldy for peeling
potatoes. This is because a cleaver has the properties of being large and
weighty, with a flat blade edge suited for chopping motion. It lacks the
properties of small, sharp, angled blade that is more suited to slicing and
peeling.




# Abstractions and Properties

- Magnitude
- Complexity
- Local and global effects.
- Temporal or sequential properties
- Boundaries and borders

[^value]: And will it remain valuable or will it diminish?

[^effort]: What does it mean to expend effort? Can "effort" be substituted for "attention" or something else?

[^parkinsons]: chances are, you've probably experienced a fair share of [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) in action.

[^process]: To make matters worse, institutions have reached for the only incumbent tools they know: process. Processes designed for managing \
assembly lines in the industrial revolution are haphazardly being applied in the office environment. But that's a rant for another time.
