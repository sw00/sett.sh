Something has been keeping me up at night for the past year. It's a statement by Jonathan Edwards, a prominent figure in the programming language design community, and it went something like this:

> Programming today is exactly what you'd expect to get by paying an isolated subculture of nerdy young men to entertain themselves for fifty years. You get a cross between Dungeons & Dragons and Rubik's Cube, elaborated a thousand-fold. I’m serious: Dungeons & Dragons requires mastery of an encyclopedia of minutiae; Rubik’s Cube is a puzzle requiring abstract mathematical thinking.

There's a lot in there, but ultimately I find it hard to refute. It is of course coming from an fundamental design perspective but I believe the general experience of working in software largely supports this view.


As someone who enjoys DnD and Rubik's cubes, I can't deny the commmon overlap
with the activity of programming. A lot of it feels similar because the software industry is founded on the work of people with
propensity for monomania and high tolerance for complexity. 

This doesn't make the accomplishments any less brilliant, however after having done some software for a time, I do feel like there is we're missing some critical perspectives. Perhaps it's where I am, but working on software certainly _feels_ like how it's described: daily work seems to involve learning and wrangling an "encyclopedia of minutiae".
