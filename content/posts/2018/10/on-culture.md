Lately, I've been thinking about how different cultures can be between
communities in our nascent field of Software Development. This notion has
probably been covered ad nauseum in the past two decades, but I think there's
so much more to unpack that have direct technical implications. No other human
endeavour seems so ubiqituous (and nebulous). It's the stuff that helps you
manage your payroll and Secret Santa office lists. It can also that can help
you send a robotic probe to a distant asteroid 90,000km away[^hyabusa].

Your lexicon of understanding is informed somewhat by the greater
cultural norms and biases in the community you're in.
