Or, in which Sett loses his shit.

Toward the end of last year I realised had lost the ability to focus. But somehow this didn't seem to make me less effective in my role - I was tech
lead, but in this case my resposibilities had drifted from the concerns of
technical delivery and seemed solely about trying to filter signal from noise
for the team. Needless to say, it was an astronomically dysfunctional and
frustrating environment. And it was turning me into a person I did not
want to be, full of bitterness, frustration and rage.

I coped with this, tried to add value in other ways but I realised
fundamentally that it was a futile endeavour - the environment was not
conducive for this kind work (more on this below). And I was drifting
increasingly away from the craft and simultaneously burning out. So I left. It
had affected me so much that I wanted to leave tech altogether too.

So I went camping alone for a little bit. I took my mountain bike. I found out
that there's a great calm that descends when the only thing you need to focus
on is preparing your next meal, or trying not to die. A state of mind not too
dissimilar to the state called flow[^flow]. In which the world is abstracted away and you're fully immersed in the present, because the task at hand requires your full attention\...

Programming is bloody difficult[^tough]. It demands your full attention and
presence. It's also incredibly rewarding and deeply satisfying. But this
satisfaction is premised on having the space and ability to practice the craft.
To achieve a state of flow. Which leads me to propose the following conjecture.

**Conjecture 1**: Flow is a necessary (but insufficient) condition for producing working software.

Ultimately, the potential for any dev team to deliver working software is
constrained by their ability to enter the state of flow. Following from this,
is the ability to collaborate and communicate. If your work environment does
not optimise for creating flow, you're severely handicapping your capacity to create value.

**Conjecture 2**: The principles of good engineering are at odds with that traditional business intuition.

The most _horrifying_ conjecture:
that the activity of software development is fundamentally incompatible
with that of the business. For all our manifestos, practices, methodologies,
technical expertise and tools suddenly rendered ineffective in the face of a
framework built on abject values, at best orthogonal to craft and engineering. What I mean is that there are activities within engineering from which you do not see immediate value. It is n times removed.
