Over time, while in an increasingly frustrating environment, I had lost the
ability to focus. Somehow, this did not make me less effective in my role,
because my role had drifted away from the technical and seemed to be entirely
about managing signal-to-noise. Programming is bloody difficult[^tough]. It
demands your full attention and presence. It's also incredibly rewarding and
deeply satisfying.  But this satisfaction is premised on having the space and
ability to practice the craft. To achieve a state of flow[^flow].

Ultimately, the potential for any dev team to deliver working software is
constrained by their ability to enter flow. Following from this, is the ability
to collaborate and communicate.

I coped with this, added value in other ways but I realised fundamentally that
it was a futile endeavour - the context was not suited for this kind work. And
lo, it dawned on me that maybe no context is. The most _horrifying_ conjecture:
that the activity of software development is fundamentally incompatible
with that of the business. For all our manifestos, practices, methodologies,
technical expertise and tools suddenly rendered ineffective in the face of a
framework built on abject values, at best orthogonal to craft and engineering.

I was drifting increasingly away from the craft and simultaneously burning out.

So I left with some wild intention of leaving tech altogether. In short, I
ragequit and went camping (after many delays).

It turns out that it's easy to enter a state of blissful flow if your life is in
danger. Camping was immersive and satisfying. There is something to be said
about having  only one thing to worry about. Survival.
