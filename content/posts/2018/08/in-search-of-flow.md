Or, In Which Sett Loses His Shit.

Toward the end of last year I realised had lost the ability to focus. To
compound matters, I was in a position where focus wasn't really required
of me - I was tech lead, but in this case my resposibilities had drifted from
the concerns of technical delivery and all of my energy was spent solely on
trying to sort signal from noise[^politics]. Needless to say, it was an
_astronomically_ dysfunctional and frustrating environment. And it was turning
me into a person I did not want to be, full of bitterness, frustration and
rage.

I coped with this, tried to add value as much I could[^working_software] but I
realised fundamentally that it was a futile endeavour - the greater environment
did not seem to be conducive for this kind work. And I was drifting
increasingly away from the craft and simultaneously burning out. So I left. It
affected me so much that I wanted to leave tech altogether too.

I went camping alone for a little bit. I took my mountain bike. It seems
there's a great calm that descends when the only thing you need to focus on is
preparing your next meal, or trying not to die. A state of mind not too
dissimilar to the state called flow[^flow]. In which the world is abstracted
away and you're fully immersed in the present, because your reaction time
matters\...

*Friendly snek[^puff_adder] on the MTB trail. To brake or to bunny hop?

I survived. And I haven't entirely given up tech. But I'm unsure if I'm
currently able to engage in full time work in an office environment, especially
for any arbitrary project or organisation. It would be unethical to dive into
something I cannot fully commit myself to[^commitment]. But I do plan to inch
my way back into the dev community. You might see me around some meetups and
conferences. 

So what am I actually up to right now? I'm still investing in learning[^unisa]
and getting good at the craft on a deeper level. I'm working on my mental
health. I'll be dabbling in technical writing as well as sharing general
software dev experiences on this blog.  There are some technical items in my
backlog I'm working through. And a particular project I have an eye on that I
quite fancy and looking for an opportunity be a part of.

TL;DR You'll see me around.

[^politics]: Too much politics, project management and general corporate madness meant I had little time to focus on helping devs learn and build.
[^working_software]: My colleagues will know working software is usually always my primary concern. I tend to obsess over it: "how do we build the right thing and what's its path to prod?"
[^puff_adder]: It was a [Puff Adder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitis_arietans)
[^flow]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)
[^unisa]: I'm enrolled in a postgrad programme with modules: Logic Programming, Ontology Engineering, Machine Learning. This takes up most of my time, as well as re-learning a whole lot of Math I've always tried to avoid.
[^commitment]: I have trouble committing to banality. It's one of my biggest deficiencies. I'm trying to work on it.
