Hello, world. It's been a while. There are some words that I've been holding on to
that I'd like to set free. I've also been hiding somewhat and now taking 
some tentative steps back into the light. This is the first meager step. 
I hope there's more to follow. Please be gentle and patient with me.

For continuity, I've cross-posted my last public appearance
[here](/posts/2017/12/four-years-infinite-gratitude).

I've always been a generalist. And this has served me well. It seems there is
utility in this trait, especially in the realm of tech, and consulting in
particular. The essence of which is being able to effectively filter noise and
extract value across many different contexts. It relies a lot on the ability to
identify patterns and make disparate connections, analogies, metaphors, models.
And the dilettante has an endless plethora of references to draw from.

Ever since I can remember, I've had the urge to learn about and understand
everything I encounter. How do countries work and why do starfish have an
uneven amount of limbs? What kind of tax system can support a standing army in
the iron age[^roman]? It was probably inevitable that I'd end up in tech. But
apart from that, I think it also translates into being more resilient to
information overload than the average person. Evidently, this resilience is
probably well suited to the oft dysfunctional[^programming_sucks] world of
software development.

All of this has an implicit trade-off (of course). It means I often
never gain a deep understanding of topics, usually because I never needed to in
order to be productive.  There's always the next thing that demands my
attention and "perfect is the enemy of good", after all. This isn't inherently
a bad thing.  In business, good enough is a immensely valuable principle to
optimise for[^pareto]. However, after spending most of my life wading through the
marshlands of ambient knowledge I think it's time to strive for more rigour and
deliberate grit. This dilettante must strive to be a polymath, but never a
specialist -- specialisation is for insects (and doctors).

[^roman]: If you're really [interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTuD149AbVI).
[^programming_sucks]: For the canonical explanation of this, see [stilldrinking.com/programming-sucks](http://www.stilldrinking.com/programming-sucks), which captures some of the worst parts of working collaboratively to build software. To be clear, it's definitely not *the worst thing ever* but does have its own challenges.
[^pareto]: Going by the [Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp), this strategy is suitable 80% of the time. But the 20% can be critical. I hope to expound on this more on this in a later post.
