This is a cross-post of my original Facebook [note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/sett-wai/four-years-infinite-gratitude/10154927130940684),
announcing my decision to exit ThoughtWorks and tech to take a break.

---

San Antonio, Kampala, Porto Alegre, San Francisco, Nairobi, Johannesburg. These
are the cities I have worked in during my time at ThoughtWorks (TW), that
quirky (yet “elite”) global IT consultancy that Martin Fowler works for, little
known outside of tech circles. Needless to say, I am the most privileged person
I know.  

But the most significant things are not the travel and silly/fancy
consulting stuff. It’s the extraordinary, dedicated, passionate people I’ve
worked with and the incredible diversity of projects (and accents) I got to
encounter at home and abroad. The sort of experiences I will remember for a
lifetime and helped me grow. 

Thank you, everyone.  

In all of this, I kept thinking how crazy that I had found a company that allowed me to be me
(mostly). Not only that, at times I would garner that I was not the biggest
oddball in the room! 

By New Year’s day next year, TW South Africa will cease
to be and I have chosen to exit the company. It’s been one heck of a ride. I
know a lot of you are disappointed and I’m truly sorry. I will be taking a
break (a sabbatical, as it’s often called). Those who know me will also know my
hangups about software development, consulting and basically white-collar
office work in general. 

It’s time for Sett to slow down, breathe and
re-orientate. To be frank, I haven’t been able to flow in a while and while I’m
not even sure if I’ll decide to remain in tech, I think my goals will always
remain the same: 

* Build cool shit 
* Make the world suck less
